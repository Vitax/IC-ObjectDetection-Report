Humans are able to recognize patterns, shapes and objects through their complex visual cortex system where they have millions of neurons and
billions of connections between them. While the Human brain can do such a task effortlessly it is impossible for a computer to process such
data. Therefore the difficulty of visual pattern detection becomes apparent when trying to implement the logic in
an algorithm.\cite{neuralnetworksanddeeplearning} \\ \\
Object detection, which is a technology related to computer vision or image processing, is a field that deals with the problem of processing
images and audio visual content.\\
Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence where the computer will perform tasks through algorithms and models. These work without explicit instructions, relying on patterns and models instead.
