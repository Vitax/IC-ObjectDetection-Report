TensorFlow™ is an open source software library for high performance numerical computation. Its flexible architecture allows easy deployment
of computation across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs), and from desktops to clusters of servers to mobile and edge devices.
Originally developed by researchers and engineers from the Google Brain team within Google’s AI organization, it comes with strong support
for machine learning and deep learning and the flexible numerical computation core is used across many other scientific
domains.\cite{tensorflow}

\section{Writing Object Detection Models with Tensorflow}
Tensorflow is a full fledged machine learning framework which support the programming languages C++, Python. It is multi purpose framework
which can be used for training Neural Networks for Image Recognition, Object Detection or other purposes. Furthermore tensorflow uses
Keras which is a high level API for building and training deep learning models. For Object Detection for which I am using Tensorflow in this
report, you are able to write a Object Detection Neural Network in multiple ways.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Do it Yourself \\ \\
        You are able to write your object detection model from scratch, starting at how features are being extracted processed and
        evaluated to how layers of your neural networks are connected, communicate and how the logic for the object localization and object
        classification is being used and implemented.
    \item Just write the Model \\
        Tensorflows object detection model which they provide with \url{https://github.com/tensorflow/models}. You are able to compose new
        ideas for models with .config files. These just contain the setup of the neural network model.
\end{itemize}
