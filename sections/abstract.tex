Today where computer software and technology is evolving fast and new fields for which applications are being developed are discovered
frequently, Machine Learning is one of those fields which is evolving and redefining Image Processing and Object / Image Detection as we
knew it.\\ \\
In this report I will write about visual information retrieval (computer vision) by Machine Learning where I will use state of the art
object detection systems depending on region proposal algorithms such as faster region-based convolutional neural networks (Faster R-CNN)
and single shot detection (SSD) networks.\\ \\
The final goal is to understand how the training process of these models work and have an application which will utilize the Tensorflow
framework with the Neural Network Models it uses to perform object detection on visual media. The result of this object detection will be an
image, video or live footage with objects highlighted through bounding boxes.
