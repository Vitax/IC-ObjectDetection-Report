Today where computer software and technologies are developing fast and new usages are being discovered frequently, Machine
Learning is evolving and redefining Image Processing and Object / Image Detection as we knew it.
\newline
\newline
In this report I will talk about visual information retrieval (computer vision) through machine learning where I will use state of the art object detection systems depending on region proposal algorithms such as faster region-based convolutional neural networks (Faster R-CNN) and single shot detection (SSD) or also known as you only look once (YOLO) networks.
\newline
\newline
The end goal is to understand how the training proces of these models work and have a application which will utilize the Tensorflow framework with the Neural Network Models it uses to perform Object Detection on visual media. The result of this Object Detection will be an image, video or live footage with objects highlighted through bounding boxes.
