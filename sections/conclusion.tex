As object detection has evolved and probably will in the future, we can see at its current state that it is able to perform complex object
detection tasks in a pretty decent way close to real time. There are still problems such as the complexity and variety of image in visual
data from real life scenario's but these types of problem may become less obvious as the amount of data stored in the net and servers world
wide is increasing and new technology are being developed. So maybe  quantum computers will bring the next breakthrough when modeling new
object detection frameworks and systems. There are still a lot of ways to improve and expand on the concept so how fast and how good it will
evolve is uncertain.
