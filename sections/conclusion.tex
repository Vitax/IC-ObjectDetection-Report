During this project I trained multiple Tensorflow models and wrote a Application which utilizes trained model through Tensorflow and is
able to detect objects in images, videos and web camera streams fairly well. Possible feature extensions is having multiple models active at the
sames time and comparing, running analyzes of the different results.\\\\
As object detection has evolved and probably will in the future, we can see at its current state that it is able to perform complex object
detection tasks in a pretty decent way close to real time. There are still problems such as the complexity and variety of image in visual
data from real life scenario's but these types of problem may become less relevant as the amount of data stored in the internet and on
servers world wide is increasing and new technology are being developed. So maybe  quantum computers will bring the next breakthrough when
modeling new object detection libraries and systems. There are still a lot of ways to improve and expand on the concept so how fast and how
good it will evolve is uncertain.
